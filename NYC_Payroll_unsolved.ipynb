    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use payroll data downloaded from NYC Open Data to answer specific questions.  These questions just scratch the surface of analysis possibilities, and if you have additional time, it would be great practice to come up with questions on your own and try to answer them with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you finish answering the questions using the provided data, you can then take the exam in Brightspace which will include questions from this data set plus more general questions about data aggregation, data grouping, and multi-level indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you will not be uploading your code to CodeGrade for checking and instead will complete this assignment and use the answers to complete a quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "As mentioned above, this data is from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e) and represents NYC employees’ salary and overtime pay data.  The following is from the data dictionary that has also been included in the download files for your reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Data is collected because of public interest in how the City’s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees. Data is input into the City's Personnel Management System (“PMS”) by the respective user Agencies. Each record represents the following statistics for every city employee: Agency, Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Agency Start Date, Work Location Borough, Job Title Description, Leave Status as of the close of the FY (June 30th), Base Salary, Pay Basis, Regular Hours Paid, Regular Gross Paid, Overtime Hours worked, Total Overtime Paid, and Total Other Compensation (i.e. lump sum and/or retro payments). This data can be used to analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime. The reader of this data should be aware that increments of salary increases received over the course of any one fiscal year will not be reflected. All that is captured, is the employee's final base and gross salary at the end of the fiscal year.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: As a part of FISA-OPA’s routine process for reviewing and releasing Citywide Payroll Data, data for some agencies (specifically NYC Police Department (NYPD) and the District Attorneys’ Offices (Manhattan, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Bronx, and Special Narcotics)) have been redacted since they are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law, POL § 87(2)(f), on the ground that disclosure of the information could endanger the life and safety of the public servants listed thereon. They are further exempt from disclosure pursuant to POL § 87(2)(e)(iii), on the ground that any release of the information would identify confidential sources or disclose confidential information relating to a criminal investigation, and POL § 87(2)(e)(iv), on the ground that disclosure would reveal non-routine criminal investigative techniques or procedures.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Important:**  The csv file is large and it may take several minutes to read the data into a DataFrame depending on your computer.  Because of the large file size, when you try to read the data, you may get a warning message about mixed data types.  To prevent this warning message, you should include a data type argument for the columns when using [pd.read_csv()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) to ensure that Pandas will use the appropriate data type.  See [this article](https://www.roelpeters.be/solved-dtypewarning-columns-have-mixed-types-specify-dtype-option-on-import-or-set-low-memory-in-pandas/) for more information on this warning message.\n",
